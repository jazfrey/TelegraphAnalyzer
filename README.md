This library features Python Scripts for the evaluation of telegraph noise.
Available are for noisy, continuously measured data sets the programs:
 - ProbabilityFitter.py 			    ( Script with fit-algorithm )
 - ContinuousMeasurement.ipynb	  ( Example Notebook for utilization )
And for random-time, single-photon data sets the programs:
 - WaitingtimeDistribution.py 		( Script with fit-algorithm )
 - WaitingtimeDistribution.ipynb	( Example Notebook for utilization )
